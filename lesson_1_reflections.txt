- How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
on windows: FC game_new.js game_old.js
on linux and mac:  diff -u game_new.js game_old.js

- How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It make easier to control the code changes.

- What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: flexibility and make the checkpoint more meaningful
cons: it is very subjective

"When choosing whether to commit, just keep in mind that each commit should have one clear, logical purpose, and you should never do too much work without committing."

- Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because very often the changes on the files are related, so you can control all the changes through the commit.

- How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log
git diff id_1 id_2


- Move the current project to one specific commit version
git checkout b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6
git checkout 3884eab839af1e82c44267484cf2945a766081f3


git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program\ Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -n -w"
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3

- Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Control code version
