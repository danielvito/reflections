When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When a want to share my project with other people or at least increase my project disponibility.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's safer to analyse any new update on the project you are working on before you pull the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy of a project from remote to remote.
Clone is a copy of a project from remote or local to local.
Branch is a copy of some version of the project into the same project. It allows one only project to hold more than one avaible version at the same time.

Branch for trying or fix features.
Clone to copy a project to local repository.
Fork to copy a project to remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It's the only way to add updates from others contributors to your local version of the project.
